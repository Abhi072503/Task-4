# Task-4
*Business Optimization using Linear Programming
In this project, I solved a real-world business optimization problem using Linear Programming with the PuLP library in Python.
The objective was to maximize profit by deciding how many chairs and tables a company should produce, given limited wood and labor resources.

‚úÖ Key Highlights:
Defined decision variables, objective function, and resource constraints
Implemented the model using PuLP
Solved the problem using the built-in solver
Interpreted the optimal solution for business use

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
Python
PuLP
Jupyter Notebook

üîç Results:
The model outputs the optimal number of chairs and tables to produce and the corresponding maximum profit, ensuring all constraints are respected.
This project demonstrates how mathematical optimization can directly guide profitable business decisions.
